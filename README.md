# Classification of somatic mutation data using Machine Learning and Deep Learning
Interpretation of somatic mutations in Acute Myeloid Leukemia using Feature Selection Techniques and Machine Learning.
Our main goal is to classify samples using somatic mutations of Acute Myeloid Leukemia. We explore different feature selection techniques and machine learning algorithms. Furthermore we examine the use of Deep learning.
